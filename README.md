The code of the example app written using Kivy an KivyMD, that you can see in action at [][you]
It' s a Passphrase generator based on Diceware. I have built it to run on Android but I also use it on my Linux desktop.
I' m a hobbist, this is just an exercise, but anyway you can use this app every time you are requested to create or modify a password or a passphrase.
This app will generate strong passphrases, long enough and easy for you to remember.

I hope this will be helpful to you.
